# reveal.js -- Notes

An improved Notes/SpeakerView plugin for Reveal.js

## Features
* Synchronization of slide and fragment changes over all three Reveal instances
* Also pause/resume and overview are synchronized
* Keyboard events also work from the Notes window when the IFrame does not have focus
* Indicators show which Iframe currently has focus in the Notes window
* The 'upcoming slide' IFrame can be used to silently navigate through the presentation -- press 'enter' to bring the selected slide to the front
* Upcoming fragments are grayed out in the Notes window -- so you know what will come up next
